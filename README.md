## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a powerful, dual-component system designed for advanced interaction with programming content and real-time monitoring, all containerized with Docker for seamless deployment.

1.  **Matplobbot (Telegram Bot)**: A sophisticated asynchronous bot built on `aiogram 3`. It serves as an intelligent gateway to programming libraries and educational materials. Its core features include interactive library browsing, full-text search, and a powerful on-demand rendering engine for LaTeX equations and Mermaid diagrams. All user interactions are meticulously logged to a shared SQLite database.

2.  **Stats Dashboard (FastAPI Web App)**: A real-time monitoring dashboard powered by `FastAPI`. It features a clean, responsive frontend built with vanilla JavaScript and `Chart.js`. The dashboard provides deep insights into bot usage statistics by querying the shared database and streams live log events directly from the bot's log file via WebSockets.

The entire ecosystem is orchestrated by Docker Compose, utilizing shared volumes for the database and logs, which ensures data consistency and perfect integration between the two services.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ Telegram Bot

The bot provides a rich, interactive experience for developers, students, and researchers.

#### Content Interaction
-   **Library Browsing**: Interactively navigate the `matplobblib` library by modules and topics (`/matp_all`).
-   **GitHub Repository Browsing**: Explore user-configured GitHub repositories file by file (`/lec_all`).
-   **Full-Text Search**: Perform deep searches within the `matplobblib` source code (`/matp_search`) and across Markdown files in your linked GitHub repositories (`/lec_search`).

#### üî¨ Dynamic On-Demand Rendering
-   **LaTeX Rendering**: Convert LaTeX equations into crisp, high-quality PNG images using the `/latex` command. Results are cached in the database for instant retrieval on subsequent requests.
-   **Mermaid.js Rendering**: Transform Mermaid diagram syntax into PNG images via the `/mermaid` command, utilizing a headless Chrome instance managed by Puppeteer.

#### üìÑ Advanced Markdown Processing
The bot features a sophisticated pipeline for displaying `.md` files from GitHub. It uses **Pandoc** augmented with **custom Lua and Python filters** to correctly process and render complex documents containing embedded LaTeX and Mermaid code.

| Display Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| üñº **Text + Images** | Renders the document directly into the chat, splitting it into a series of text messages and generated images for equations and diagrams. |
| üìÑ **HTML File** | Generates a fully self-contained `.html` file, bundling all necessary CSS and JS. Mermaid diagrams are interactive. |
| ‚ö´ **MD File** | Sends the original, raw `.md` file without any processing. |

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Personalization & User Management
-   **Favorites (`/favorites`)**: Bookmark useful code examples from your searches for quick access later.
-   **Settings (`/settings`)**: A comprehensive inline menu allows users to:
    -   Toggle the display of code docstrings.
    -   Select their preferred Markdown display mode.
    -   Fine-tune LaTeX rendering quality (DPI and padding).
    -   Manage their personal list of GitHub repositories.

#### üëë Administration
-   **Live Library Updates (`/update`)**: (Admin-only) Fetches the latest version of the `matplobblib` library from PyPI and dynamically reloads the module without bot downtime.
-   **Cache Management (`/clear_cache`)**: (Admin-only) Instantly purges all application caches, including in-memory `TTLCache` for API calls and the persistent LaTeX cache in the database.

### üìä Web Dashboard

The dashboard provides a live, data-rich view of the bot's health and user engagement.

</div>

-   **Real-time Updates**: All statistical charts and counters update instantly via **WebSocket** connections, providing a true live monitoring experience.
-   **Rich Data Visualization**:
    -   Total user actions counter.
    -   Leaderboard of the most active users, complete with their Telegram avatars.
    -   Bar charts for the most frequently used commands and text messages.
    -   A pie chart visualizing the distribution of action types (e.g., command vs. callback query).
    -   A line chart illustrating user activity over time.
-   **Live Log Streaming**: A live feed of the `bot.log` file is streamed directly to the web UI, enabling real-time operational monitoring.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive interface with automatic **light and dark theme** support.

The project is built on modern, asynchronous frameworks with a strong emphasis on modularity and separation of concerns.

| Category | Technology & Key Libraries |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python 3.11+ |
| **Bot Framework** | **Aiogram 3** (utilizing `Router` for modular handlers) |
| **Web Framework** | **FastAPI**, Uvicorn |
| **Database** | **SQLite** (accessed asynchronously via `aiosqlite`) |
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, **Chart.js** |
| **Containerization** | **Docker, Docker Compose** |
| **Rendering Pipeline** | **Pandoc** with custom Lua & Python filters, **TeX Live**, dvipng, **Mermaid-CLI**, Puppeteer |
| **Key Libraries** | `aiohttp`, `cachetools`, `python-dotenv` |

### Architectural Highlights
-   **Decoupled Services**: The bot and the web dashboard run in separate Docker containers but communicate through a shared database and log volume, creating a robust, microservice-like architecture.
-   **Modular Handlers**: The bot's logic is cleanly organized into feature-specific modules (`admin`, `rendering`, `settings`, etc.), each with its own `aiogram.Router`.
-   **Service Layer**: Complex business logic, such as rendering documents and interacting with the GitHub API, is abstracted into a dedicated `services` package.
-   **Asynchronous Everywhere**: From database calls (`aiosqlite`) to external API requests (`aiohttp`), the entire stack is asynchronous to ensure high performance and scalability.
-   **Intelligent Caching**: In-memory `TTLCache` is used extensively to cache GitHub API responses, reducing rate-limiting and speeding up user-facing operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

The project is fully containerized, enabling a simple and reproducible setup.

### 1. Prerequisites
-   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed on your system.

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Fill it out using the template below.

```env
# Get this from @BotFather on Telegram
BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11

# Your personal Telegram User ID for admin command access
ADMIN_USER_ID=123456789

# GitHub Personal Access Token with 'repo' scope for reading repositories
# Required for /lec_search, /lec_all, and uploading rendered LaTeX images
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Running with Docker Compose

This is the recommended method for running the project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ackrome/matplobbot.git
    cd matplobbot
    ```

2.  **Ensure your `.env` file is created and configured** as described above.

3.  **Build and run the services in detached mode:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

### 4. Accessing the Services

-   **Telegram Bot**: Will be active and available on Telegram.
-   **Web Dashboard**: Open `http://localhost:9583` in your browser.

### 5. Stopping the Services

-   To stop all running containers, execute:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```-   Your database and log files will persist in named volumes. To remove all data, run `docker-compose down -v`.
